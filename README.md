Welcome!

I created this new GitHub account to consolidate the repos I am actively maintaining and showcasing.

While I work through that process, you can view some of my previous work here:

- [@gldnspud](https://github.com/gldnspud) — personal repos on my old account
- [@11craft](https://github.com/11craft) — a few small Python libraries, some actively maintained
- [@schevo](https://github.com/schevo) - Python-oriented database system (retired)
- [@fanscribed](https://github.com/fanscribed) - podcast transcription app using Django (retired)
